When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Any time I am on a workstation that does not belong to me I would want to use a remote repository I would think.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a project that becomes my personal copy. A clone is a duplicate of a project. A branch a copy of the project for the purpose of making a change.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The project is ready to be worked on regardless of connection status. The changes being made won't conflict with previous changes.
