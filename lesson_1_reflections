I was able to read the differences in files in close proximity in order to figure out the differences.

I can check changes, and help remember what I was thinking. I can also track productivity.

Mannually choosing a commit gives me control, however, if I am distracted and don't commit for a long time then I could mis out on an auto option.

Software comes in packages while google docs is typically individual files. Things like websites and object oriented programs use multiple files.

git log shows all the history of the changes. git diff shows a comparison of what was changed between the two versions.

I am aware that I can very easily go back to an earlier version of my program.

I want to use git for version control.
